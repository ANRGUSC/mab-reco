# A c-MAB based Recommendation System with Clustering Feature

The code snippets in this folder is structured with **Backend** - **Intermediate** - **Frontend** 

For the **Backend** code file:

```
ContextualMAB.py connects with the database, updates designated user's MAB score and clustering data, and makes recommendations. 
```

For the **Intermediate** code file:

```
MABInstance.py communicates with the frontend and the backend to provide user feedback and offer user suggestions generated by the backend.
```

For the **Frontend** code files, they all use the same **Backend** and **Intermediate** code files:

```
discord_main.py creates a discord bot that interact with the user to give recommendations and collect user's feedback.
```
```
telegram_main.py creates a telegram bot that interact with the user to give recommendations and collect user's feedback.
```
```
./mab-reco-app/main.py creates a PWA software interact with the user to give recommendations and collect user's feedback on mobile devices.
```

Some binary files:

```
gen_pivot.py generates pre-designed cluster pivot for clusters. This is for testing and can be modified. 
```
```
sim_users.py creates simulated users with unique behaviors that acts based on Gaussian's Distribution with some level of noise. This is for testing and can be modified. 
```
```
configuration.yaml contains parameters that can be modified in the backend and intermediate code files makes the system very versatile to fulfill different needs.
